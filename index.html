    <h1>What is Roller Derby?</h1>
    <br>  
    <p>
        Roller Derby is a contact sport played on roller skates.<br><br> 
        Two teams of five players skate on an oval track, with each team designating one player as the "jammer" who scores points by lapping members of the opposing team.<br><br>
        The other players, called "blockers," use their bodies to block the opposing jammer and help their own jammer score points.<br><br>
        Points are also scored by the jammer if they pass members of the opposing team.<br><br> The game consists of multiple "jams" in which both teams send their jammer out to score points, and is typically a very physical and fast-paced sport.

        <h1>History</h1> 
        <br>       
        <p>Originally Roller Derby was a marathon on skates, played by two competing teams with both men and women on each team.<br><br>
          It was played on a banked track.<br><br>
          It was started in the 1930s by Leo Seltzer and Damon Runyon in the US.<br><br>
          It gradually became a form of "sports entertainment" with scripted bout and predetermined winners, where the focus was on
          spectacle and not sport.<br><br>
          This version of Roller Derby died out in the US during the early 1970s.

    <h1>Rebirth in the 2000s</h1>
    <br>   
    <p> Roller Derby was reborn in Texas in the early 2000s. <br><br>After the initial failure of Daniel Eduardo Policarpo, who formed a production company called "Bad Girl Goood Woman Productions", to promote the sport.<br><br>
      However a large number of players for this promotion were unhappy with the managmement of it, left to form their team that ultimately became Texas Roller Girls.<br><br>
      From there the sport began to grow and this then lead to the creation of the WFTDA in 2005 to promote and regualte the new sport of Roller Derby.<br><br>
