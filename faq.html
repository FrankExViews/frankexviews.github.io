<h1>What Equipment Do I Need To Bring?</h1>





<div id="ans2" class="answer">
<p>
Usually the trip or cruise you are taking part, will provide a suggested list of equipment.
The cruise we went on provided an insulated jacket, meaning you didn't need to bring your own.
A "clean" spare winter jacket jacket to wear around the ship, is a nice thing to have on your trip.

I would recommend the following:

<ul>
<li>Sunscreen! Factor 50 is ideal, sun is extremely strong, even on over cast days.</li>
<li>Seasickness tablets, while you can likely get these onboard a ship, having your own supply in reach is best.</li>
<li>Waterproof trousers, these will keep your legs dry during Zodiac boat trips. </li>
<li>Waterproof ski gloves, very important for the Zodiac boat trips and keeping your hands warm on deck.</li>
<li>Insulated wellingtons/rubber boots. Nearly all your Zodiac boat landings will be "wet", and you will be getting off your Zodiac in a few inches of water. <br> A proper set of insulated rubber boots will keep your feet warm and dry. Ideally a set that are knee high are highly recommended. </li>
<li>Binouclars or monoculars: I didn't bring either of these on our trip and these were not available for sale on the ship. Well worth bringing a set.</li>
<li>Warm peaked hat, ideally with one or two spares.</li>
<li>Snoods/neck gaiters to wear around your neck, more convient that a scarf and they can be stretched over a baseball cap to keep your ears warm. </li>

</ul>

<h1>What Are The Weather/Sea Condtions Like?</h1>



<div id="ans3" class="answer">
    <p>Temperatures for our trip, on land, were about 0 Degrees Celsius. Normally at the time of year, Decmber/January weather can be quite overcast, but we were very lucky had had several days of beautiful sunshine with almost no clouds. <br><br>
        As regards seasickness and the seas: condtions will vary wildly. You are passing through Drake's passage to get to and from Antarctica from South America, Drakes Passage can be extremely rough.<br>
        <br> We were very lucky with our trips through the passage and the ship we were on had stabilizer fins which also helps greatly.
        It is very hard to tell ahead of time how you will fare with seasickness, especalliy if it is your first cruise, so do pack seasickness tabletes and be prepared for the fact you will experience some.
