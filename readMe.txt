concept: picture gallery site, hosting pictures on a hooeymoon in Antartica.
Includes a basic index page with an itinerary, a gallery page a d a FAQ page.

I have had to remove the images from this submission due to file size limits of 5MB.

You should be able to get a copy of the img and gallery folders from GitHub. They just need to be copied into the root directory with the other files.
